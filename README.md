Localhost Automate
==================

Problem
-------
As a developer working under his Localhost server before uploading a project to the WWW, I've encountered one issue (or a disturbance, so to speak) that somehow always takes away 3-4 seconds of my workflow and disturbs me with annoyance.

After opening a web document, whether if its an html file, php file or anything else, Google Chrome opens it under file:// protocol instead of http://, resulting in developers clicking on the address bar just to switch to http://localhost.


Solution
--------

Localhost Automate is what solves it.

Localhost Automate provides an easier, more comfortable way to tell the browser to get the http://localhost up there instead of file://, as long as the web document is in the preconfigured folder.

Localhost Automate requires a valid path to your localhost folder (ie. d:\wwwroot), so afterwards, if you're opening a file under 'd:\wwwroot\Some_Project', the extension would redirect it to 'http://localhost/Some_Project'.

Comments, bugs and suggestions are welcome. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed making it.
